        ======================

        The issue tracker is meant for feature requests, bug reports, and documentation issues only. This isn't the best place for
        support or usage questions. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before
        you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

        - ðŸ“– Study [the documentation](https://twind.style)
        - ðŸ¤– Try [the playground](https://twind.run)
        - ðŸ§­ Explore [the examples](https://twind.style/examples)
        - ðŸ““ Consult [the API reference](https://twind.style/packages)
        - ðŸ§µ Use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/discussions) for message-board style questions and discussions that would benefit from being searchable.
        - ðŸ’¬ Ask questions and discuss with other Twind users in real time on [Discord Chat](https://chat.twind.style).
