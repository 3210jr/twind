        Do you need some help?
        ======================
        The issue tracker is meant for feature requests and bug reports only. This isn't the best place for
        support or usage questions. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before
        you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

        - Read [the docs](https://twind.style)
        - Explore [the examples](https://twind.style/examples)
        - Use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/discussions) for message-board style questions and discussions that would benefit from being searchable.
        - Ask questions and discuss with other Twind users in real time on [Discord Chat](https://chat.twind.style).

        ### Test Case Starter:

  - type: textarea
    id: reproduction
    attributes:
      label: Reproduction
      description: |
        Please create a [minimal reproduction](https://minimum-reproduction.wtf)

        - on [twind.run](https://twind.run/bug-report) ‚Äî use the _Something broken? File a bug!_ link on the top-right, or copy the share link and then paste the link here
        - or use one of the [examples](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/tree/next/examples#readme) for Stackblitz or Codesandbox that reproduces the issue

        Explaining how to reproduce is generally not enough. It pushes the burden of creating a reproduction
        onto a small set of volunteer maintainers and isn't scalable.

        If no reproduction is provided, the issue will be closed.
