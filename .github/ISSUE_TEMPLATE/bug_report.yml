        Do you need some help?
        ======================
        The issue tracker is meant for feature requests and bug reports only. This isn't the best place for
        support or usage questions. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before
        you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

        - Read [the docs](https://twind.dev)
        - Explore [examples](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/tree/next/examples#readme)
        - Ask in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/discussions)
        - Ask in [Discord Chat](https://discord.com/invite/2aP5NkszvD)

        ### Test Case Starter:

  - type: textarea
    id: reproduction
    attributes:
      label: Reproduction
      description: |
        A [minimal reproduction](https://minimum-reproduction.wtf) on Stackblitz or Codesandbox of an
        [example](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/tree/next/examples#readme) that reproduces the issue.

        Explaining how to reproduce is generally not enough. It pushes the burden of creating a reproduction
        onto a small set of volunteer maintainers and isn't scalable.

        If no reproduction is provided, the issue will be closed.
