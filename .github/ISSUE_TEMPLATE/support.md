# Do you need some help?

Hey there! If you need help or tech support then this is not the place to ask. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. The issue tracker is meant for feature requests, bug reports, and documentation issues only. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

- 📖 Study [the documentation](https://twind.style)
- 🤖 Try [the playground](https://twind.run)
- 🧭 Explore [the examples](https://twind.style/examples)
- 📓 Consult [the API reference](https://twind.style/packages)
- 🧵 Use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/discussions) for message-board style questions and discussions that would benefit from being searchable.
- 💬 Ask questions and discuss with other Twind users in real time on [Discord Chat](https://chat.twind.style).

If you arrived here because you think [Twind's documentation](https://twind.style) is unclear, insufficient, or wrong, please consider [creating an issue for the documentation](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/issues/new?template=docs.yml) instead.
